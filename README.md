# Privasight

This is the version that attempts to have an SQLite database saved in indexedDB. 
But there are some issues with this version. In most situations, the database failed to persist the data but it also works in some occasions under the same settings. 
The use of the SQLite database is referenced from https://github.com/SteveSandersonMS/BlazeOrbital and https://github.com/TrevorDArcyEvans/BlazorSQLiteWasm
